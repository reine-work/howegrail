                        <p>As closet romantics with huge love tanks, both Celeste and Jorge have always dreamed of having a grand, epic kind of fairytale love - of finding someone who could be, “their person”, who would share their same lofty hopes and ambitious dreams, geeky quirks and (tasteful/tasteless) sense of humor, life philosophies and core values, who they could BUILD with together in the ultimate co-op adventure game of life. </p> 

                        <p>In fact, several times prior to meeting, Celeste and Jorge’s paths crossed as "ships passing in the night". Celeste was born and raised in Saudi Arabia to Filipino parents and came to Manila for college at the age of 15, just shortly before Jorge’s departure for the US. In 2019, they were in Dubai at the same time, and in 2020, Celeste first overheard Jorge’s voice during a work conference call. </p>

                        <p>Celeste and Jorge finally met, of all places, at a crypto event in May 2022. While Jorge was there to visit a friend, upon entering the venue, he immediately saw Celeste, was instantly captivated by her supernatural beauty, and went straight to her, leaving his friends behind.</p>

                        <p>They had immediate chemistry and were just aligned on so many things, ranging from their shared love for megacities (over overrated beaches), to the NFTs they purchased, to the formative experiences growing up abroad but finding their own paths back home to Manila. Jorge went traveling right after their initial encounter, but they stayed in contact every single day, sometimes just to send each other the goofy, uncouth and dank memes they both enjoyed, at other times for relaxing conversations around trending anime and video games, to essay long back-and-forths about their life philosophies, fears and aspirations. They had numerous intentional conversations early on about their family values, and their desires and goals in raising their ideal family.</p>

                        <p>Naturally, their first date was to watch Celeste’s favorite anime movie Jujutsu Kaisen, followed by dinner at a Japanese restaurant they closed down (for staying too late!), and an introduction to Celeste’s Maltese puppy Misho (who is now Jorge’s son). Celeste very quickly became Jorge’s best friend, only she was a girl, and she was gorgeous! Among other things, she had the biggest heart and an incredible caretaker mentality, and he thought to himself that she would unequivocally be the best mother in the world. And that he NEEDED her to be the mother of his children.</p> 

                        <p>Because Jorge was obsessed with Celeste and started seeing her every single day, she asked him early into their relationship if he thought they were "moving too fast". To which Jorge affirmed clearly, "NO". To him, it did not seem as much as they were "moving too fast"; but rather that we were just "catching up". It felt as if they had met or knew each other in some way before, given how easy it was to feed off each other's energy, how compatible they were, and how jointly singular their values and dreams were. It truly felt as if they were soulmates who were separated and finally reconciled, and it was so natural to just rebuild their foundation quickly. </p>

                        <p>The full journey and magic of their relationship (or as they like to say, their "relationSIMP") is of course too much to cover in its entirety in this summary - as it spans literally every aspect of their lives, from regular fitness / gym sessions, to epic travel adventures (SG, HK, diving in Amanpulo, Siargao, Shanghai, UK, US, Japan), to even their daily routines, their shared work in crypto and investing (and weathering the 2022-2023 crypto bear market), their family and friendships, and the countless events they attend together. </p>

                        <p>Jorge once received a beautiful note from Celeste written on an intricate, Japanese-inspired pop-up 3D card. In it, she mentioned that perhaps why God had kept her from going to Japan all this time (canceled for one reason or another multiple times), was because He meant for her first time there - to be with Jorge. </p>

                        <p>It was at this point when the gears in Jorge’s mind first started turning to devise his proposal (almost a year prior to it actually happening in October 2023), as at that moment he just KNEW it had to be in Japan. Japan was a special place for them, as Celeste has romanticized the country all her life, through all the Japanese media and culture she consumed. Again, they first truly bonded over anime and Japanese RPGs, their first date was a Japanese movie followed by a Japanese restaurant, and they both just love all things Japan!</p>

                        <p>And so in secret, Jorge planned what he thought would be a proposal she would love, that would also be uniquely “them”. They both love Japan, and they love the CITY. So Jorge’s grand plan was to set up a "perfect day" for them in Tokyo that would end in a proposal at night. This idea of a "perfect day” started off with a private tour of Tokyo to see several iconic and hidden gems of the city - from Akihabara, the anime district, to Asakusa, the historical district, to Tsukiji Fish Market, and all the way to charming and quaint parts of town like Yanaka (known for its romantic sunset steps and suburban village vibes). They also got to experience Tokyo by sky via a private helicopter tour where they saw the stunning megapolis in its entire glory from 10,000 feet above ground. Finally at night, they headed to a private room at Sezzane, one of the best French restaurants in the world that had a distinctly urban view (again, because they love cities) of the Tokyo skyline. Jorge secretly decorated the room with candles, other ornaments, and wisteria flowers hanging from the ceiling to make the ambience more romantic and distinctly urban-Japanese. The room was directly above the iconic Tokyo Station, where the dozens of shinkansen lines (they like trains) came together in a beautiful myriad of intersections.</p>

                        <p>It was here that Jorge formally asked his best friend, confidante, and dream woman to marry him, where he put the diamond ring his grandparents had passed down to him onto her finger, pleasantly surprised that it was an absolute perfect fit. Seeing that ring on her finger, and the emotion in her face - was pure magic and ecstasy. He knew where he was meant to be, and she knew it too. His proposal speech of course ended with an homage to the theme first mentioned above.</p>

                        <p><strong>"At Tokyo station, trains bound by the same tracks are destined to meet. In life, people bound by destiny will always find each other."</strong></p>
