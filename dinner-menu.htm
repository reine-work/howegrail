                                    <p>Food is our love language, and there will be plenty of it at the wedding. While there will be a curated set of appetizer booths and snacks from the ceremony through the reception, we encourage guests to save some room for dinner, which will be a 7-course experience presented by Chef Stephan Duhesme and Chef Arlo Gregorio of <a href="https://metizresto.com/" target="_blank">Métiz.</a></p>
    
                                    <p>Métiz has received numerous accolades for their stellar cuisine, holding a spot in the <a href="https://www.theworlds50best.com/asia/en/the-list/metiz.html" target="_blank">Asia's Best 50 restaurants</a>. The restaurant serves a tasting menu that exhibits world class, modern cooking techniques inspired by traditional Filipino flavors, highlighting the best of local Philippine biodiversity. Chef Steph himself has had a seasoned and decorated career <a href="https://peopleasia.ph/stephan-duhesme-metiz/" target="_blank">(https://peopleasia.ph/stephan-duhesme-metiz/)</a> and has been featured as <a href="https://www.tatlerasia.com/dining/food/tatler-dining-special-awards-2024" target="_blank">Tatler Dining’s Chef of the Year.</a></p>
    
                                    <p>This is the first time EVER that Métiz is offering a dining experience at a scale of 300-400 guests, and their team will be supported by the <a href="https://bizu.ph/" target="_blank">Bizu Group</a>, another powerhouse in the local food and events industry. </p>
    
                                    <p>For our wedding, Chefs Steph and <a href="https://www.instagram.com/notarlo_/?hl=en" target="_blank">Arlo</a> have designed a custom menu that bakes in elements of both our life stories. Dishes are influenced by nostalgic flavors from our childhood years and pay homage to the Chinese culture Jorge grew up in and the Middle-eastern elements that shaped Celeste’s early life, all anchored together by our shared Filipino roots. The final menu was crafted as a result of multiple iterations of brainstorming sessions, tastings, and commentary exchanges between the Chefs and ourselves, so every bite of this menu truly does represent a story that is close to our hearts. Since this is a bespoke menu not offered in the main restaurant, we still encourage all our guests to experience either the flagship Métiz restaurant experience itself (but book early!), or their newly opened sister restaurant <a href="https://www.instagram.com/automat.mnl/?hl=en" target="_blank">Automat.</a></p>
    
                                    <p>As many guests will know, Jorge and his family are known for their love of food (perhaps too much), and while they have thousands of Michelin stars worth of restaurants under their belts, Métiz remains among an undisputed family favorite. (Btw we are confident that Chefs Steph and Arlo will also earn their Michelin distinction when results are finally published for Manila!) It is an honor and privilege to have such a distinguished team prepare what we hope to be to be a memorable meal during the most special night of our lives, with the people we love and value the most.</p>
